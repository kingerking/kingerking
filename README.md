### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal side projects, team side project(s).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source software.
- Ask me about React, Express, Node.js, Next.JS, MongoDB or Socket.io(MERN stack or JAM).
- Im looking for help with nothing. Im a coding beast ðŸ™„ Just kidding! I could use help with the Rust language. And potentially general design patterns as i primarly focus on the backend sort of things.
- You can reach me on my portfolio website https://kylekinger.com.
- Im currently looking to learn Rust so i can write some custom Web Assembly modules for my up and coming project that would greatly benifit from Web Assembly.
